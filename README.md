# About Me
I am currently finishing up my senior year at Southern New Hampshire University, and will be graduating in April of 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and minors in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Research. 

## Research Project
[Here](https://hdl.handle.net/10474/3709) is the link to my group research project, a study and analysis of the Impact of Chytrid Fungus on New Hampshire Frog Populations. 



# Biostatistics
Below are some of the projects I have done in Biostatistics.

## Work with Penguins

This was the first data set I analyzed while learning how to use R. The analysis we ran used a small subset of 44 penguins. My analysis of that data is [here](https://melaniedube.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html). 


## Work with Volcanic Eruptions

This was the second data analysis I conducted in Bioinformatics class. I chose to work with a data set on volcanic eruptions, which was a much larger set than my original analysis with pengiuins. My analysis is linked [here](https://melaniedube.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/VolcanicEruptionsAnalysis.html).

## Work with Australian Fires
This was an additional analysis that I conducted as part of our final project for Bioinformatics class. This data set was on fires in Australia, but I focused on data regarding rainfall and temperature, and where data collection sites were located. My analysis is linked [here](https://melaniedube.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/AustralianFires.html).



# Bioinformatics
This was my first analysis specifically in bioinformatics. The goal of this report was to attempt to find the origin of replication for different genomes. The report with each of its different parts is linked [here](https://agmath.github.io/BIO4ST1_Group2/Replication_Melanie_Dube.html).
