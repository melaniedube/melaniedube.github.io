# Welcome
This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in Biostatistics. So far, I have done some analysis of data on penguins, as well as data on volcanic eruptions.

## Work with Penguins

This was the first data set I analyzed while learning how to use R. The analysis we ran used a small subset of 44 penguins. My analysis of that data is [here](https://melaniedube.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html). 


## Work with Volcanic Eruptions

This was the second data analysis I conducted in Bioinformatics class. I chose to work with a data set on volcanic eruptions, which was a much larger set than my original analysis with pengiuins. My analysis is linked [here](https://melaniedube.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/VolcanicEruptionsAnalysis.html).

## Work in Bioinformatics
I began working on a Bioinformatics report, attempting to find the origin of replication for different genomes. The report is linked [here] (https://github.com/agmath/BIO4ST1_Group2/blob/e607255f9b703e0ee08ad2561d6c75ee6086c1be/Replication_Melanie_Dube.html)
