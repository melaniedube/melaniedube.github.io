This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. So far, I have done some analysis of data on penguins, as well as data on volcanic eruptions.

## Work with Penguins

This was the first data set I analyzed while learning how to use R. The analysis we ran used a small subset of 44 penguins. My analysis of that data is here.
